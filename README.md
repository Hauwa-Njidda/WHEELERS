## Development Environment

Expo React native is the best tool to use. It helps remove complex problems and makes everything easier to undertand.
The first thing is to make sure you are running node version 12 or higher.
 Make sure you are running verison 12 or higher. Next, export cli locally "npm sudo i -g expo-cli" (if you are using mac "sudo sudo i -g expo-cli").
 Also, install "expo client" on the app store this will be easier to run an app.
 You then download visual studio from https://code.visualstudio.com/.

 Next in the Visual Studio we will be needing some extension this will make the work a lot easier. These are:
 - React native tools
 - React native/ React/ Reduck Snip
 - Prettier - Code formatter
 - material icon theme 


## Expo Project

Now that the environment is all done now moving to the setting of the project.

So in the termainal window, type "expo init WHEELERS" that will be the name of the app
You will next choose the workflow for the app. Which will be the manage workflow. 
This will make everything neat. This will take a while.

Next open it on VS Code and move my soruce code to the actual environment. Subtitute the 
Necessary floders to make everything organised.
